# Version-Control
Question 1: Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual  developer and as part of a development team? 

Benefits of a Version Control System include;  

Collaboration – The ability to collaborate with others on documents is particularly important as it supports efficiency by allowing multiple individuals to focus and contribute on their own	 part of the document at the same time.

Track, Record and merge changes – This provides those working on documents to keep track of changes made to a document and to clearly see what those changes have been. This is useful to allow an individual to review and approve or reject those changes prior to merging them into the main document. 

Prevention of information loss – without a version control system any changes made to the main document could be lost through inadvertently overwriting the document. Poor quality naming conventions can result in multiple versions of the same document, and this is avoided with a VCS.  

Ability to Revert to previous versions - this is particularly useful in the event of an error, allowing software to be rolled back to a previous working version. 

 

There are various types of version control systems available with varying levels of complexity. 

For instance there are complex systems such as Github, which is a distributed version control system that allows collaboration with other developers on shared projects, provides an audit trail of progress and keeps track of changes. It allows individuals and teams to work without risk of loss to the main document whilst providing the ability to roll back to previous versions. 

Alternatively developers may choose to use a basic version control such as a simple proto-versioning system where version control of documents uses a basic system of iteration such as doc1, doc2 etc.  

Both of these version controls systems have different features with their own benefits and challenges, to compare…. 

The audit feature within Github allows users to see all changes made to a document by all contributors, which is beneficial when trying to solve problems or fix bugs. The basic VCS does not keep track of all changes, and if the track changes feature is enabled, once approved the history of amendments is lost. 

There is a risk with the basic VCS that a file could be overwritten as it is the master copy being worked on and saved iteratively each time. This is prevented in Github as individuals are working on their own version, which is only merged with the master copy after peer review. 

With GitHub it is easier to identify and rollback to a previous working version of a particular piece of code if required, this is much harder to do with the basic VCS as the rollback function will remove all changes made since the last update.
